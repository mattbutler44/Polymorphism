# Polymorphism

This program is console or terminal based (i.e. there is no GUI).

Compile the .java files on your computer. In Windows: cd {directory} {enter} javac *.java

This program was made in a programming class.

This program uses polymorphism in the form of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract methods and classes.
There are a handful of layers from super (parent) class to subclasses, some of which of their own subclasses.
They implement an interface that is common to all classes, even of different objects.

Interface "Payable" is implemented by an Invoice and many different types of Employees.

The main focus of this project is the demonstration of polymorphism and inheritance.
